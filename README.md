WSN using IoT
- An automatic greenhouse monitoring system based on the Zigbee communication protocol for the Internet of Things. Four microcontrollers are used to control a greenhouse system to adapt to the cultivation of tomato. Each microcontroller contains a temperature sensor, light sensor, CO2 sensor, and soil moisture sensor. Three of those sensors which are analogue were designed and implemented. The node connection method is a star network connection. To ensure that no congestion or collision occurs during data transmission, this report uses TDMA communication and also designs a CRC error correction mechanism. The microcontroller is connected to the Raspberry Pi via the RS232 bus, and the Raspberry Pi uploads the data to the cloud via wifi. In addition, the report is used for the ThingSpeak cloud platform for visual data monitoring.
